## Introduction

Which movies were released in 2020? Were they any good? Wonder no more! Randy's Totoos* is here to help!

*legally distinct from Rotten Tomatoes

When you visit the site, you're transported to the distant past, when people went to movie theaters. View the posters for all movies released in 2020 and click on each of them for more details.

This app was built according to [this spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) and gave us a solid working knowledge of three new technologies: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). We focused on making sure that we were organized from the beginning, and we kept the end goal in mind while working through each small issue. We enjoyed celebrating the wins, and we reached out for help when we got stuck.
